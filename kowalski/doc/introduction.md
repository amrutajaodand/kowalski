# Kowalski 1.0

The legendary [ZTF](https://ztf.caltech.edu) time domain astronomy penguin: 
`docker`-ized and powered by `aiohttp` and `mongodb` to deliver improved performance and robustness.

## Python client `penquins`

Install the client library [penquins.py](https://github.com/dmitryduev/kowalski/blob/master/penquins.py), 
with `pip` into your environment:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/dmitryduev/kowalski.git
```

`penuquins` is very lightweight and only depends on `pymongo` and `requests`.
